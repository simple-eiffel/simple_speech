				SIMPLE_SPEECH - Main facade for speech-to-text operations.
		
				Swiss Army knife speech-to-text library with:
				- File transcription (WAV)
				- PCM sample transcription
				- Multi-language support (99+ via whisper)
				- Configurable threading
				- Optional translation to English
		
				Example:
					speech: SIMPLE_SPEECH
					create speech.make ("models/ggml-base.en.bin")
					if speech.is_valid then
						segments := speech.transcribe_file ("audio.wav")
						across segments as seg loop
							print (seg.text + "%N")
						end
					end
		
				Architecture:
				- Uses SPEECH_ENGINE abstraction for loose coupling
				- Default engine: WHISPER_ENGINE (whisper.cpp)
				- Engine can be injected for testing or alternative backends
		
				CQS Pattern:
				- Commands (procedures): set_language, set_threads, set_translate
				- Fluent queries: with_language, with_threads, with_translate
