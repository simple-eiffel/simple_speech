# Marketing & Go-To-Market Plan for **simple_speech**

## Executive Summary

**simple_speech** is no longer a speech-to-text library. Across **Phases 0–7**, it has become a **local-first media intelligence pipeline** that:

- transcribes audio/video
- detects topic and scene transitions
- generates chapters and structure
- embeds captions and chapters directly into media files

With **Phase 8 (Real-Time Streaming)** explicitly on deck, the product now supports a **clear, escalating narrative** that is ideal for sustained visibility, credibility, and adoption.

This plan defines **how to market simple_speech now**, using each phase as *proof points* rather than raw feature lists.

---

## One-Sentence Positioning (Canonical)

> **simple_speech is a local-first speech-to-text and media-structuring engine that automatically turns raw audio and video into navigable, captioned, chaptered media — with real-time streaming coming next.**

This sentence anchors:
- README
- GitHub description
- launch posts
- demos

## What You Are Actually Selling (Reframed)

You are selling **structure and delivery**, not transcription.

| Capability | Market Perception |
|---------|------------------|
| Transcription | Commodity |
| Captions | Expected |
| Chapters | Rare |
| Embedded media metadata | Extremely rare |
| Offline determinism | High-trust differentiator |
| Streaming (coming) | Platform signal |

This framing must be consistent everywhere.

---

## Phase-Based Narrative (Marketing Backbone)

Each phase exists not just for engineering — but as a **storytelling rung**.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation: Deterministic STT

**What shipped**
- Whisper.cpp integration
- Fully local execution
- Deterministic outputs

**Marketing signal**
- “Offline-first, no cloud, no uploads”

**Audience resonance**
- Developers
- Privacy-sensitive users

---

## Phase 1 — Audio Ingestion & Normalization

**What shipped**
- Robust audio decoding
- Format normalization
- Clean timestamp alignment

**Marketing signal**
- “Works on real-world audio, not just clean demos”

---

## Phase 2 — Video Support

**What shipped**
- Audio extraction from video
- Full video transcription support

**Marketing signal**
- “Transcribe video without special tooling”

**New audience unlocked**
- Creators
- Educators

---

## Phase 3 — Caption Formats

**What shipped**
- SRT
- VTT
- Subtitle timing precision

**Marketing signal**
- “Accessibility-ready outputs”

**External hook**
- Accessibility deadlines (EAA, WCAG)

---

## Phase 4 — Language & AI Enhancements

**What shipped**
- Language detection
- Optional translation
- AI-enhanced cleanup

**Marketing signal**
- “AI when it helps — never when it harms determinism”

---

## Phase 5 — Batch & Pipeline Readiness

**What shipped**
- Batch processing
- Predictable memory usage
- Scriptable workflows

**Marketing signal**
- “Built for pipelines, not one-off runs”

---

## Phase 6 — Smart Chaptering (Topic & Scene Detection)

**What shipped**
- Topic transition detection
- Scene segmentation
- `SPEECH_CHAPTER` data model

**Marketing signal (primary hook)**
- “Automatic chapters for audio and video — no manual timestamps”

**This is the inflection point.**

---

## Phase 7 — Embedded Media Intelligence

**What shipped**
- Caption embedding (soft subtitles)
- Chapter embedding (media-native metadata)
- Single-file intelligent media output

**Marketing signal (headline feature)**
- “Your media ships with its own structure built in”

**Why this matters**
- No sidecar files
- Portable across players and platforms
- Final-form deliverables

---

## Phase 8 — Real-Time Streaming (Coming Soon)

**What’s coming**
- Non-blocking streaming transcription
- Incremental chapter formation
- SCOOP-safe concurrency model

**Marketing signal (teaser)**
- “Structure-aware transcription in real time”

**Important:** Phase 8 should be marketed as *coming*, not demoed prematurely.

---

## Target Audiences (Updated)

### 1. Developers / Engineers (Primary)

**Why they care**
- Deterministic
- Scriptable
- No cloud dependency

**Channels**
- GitHub
- Hacker News
- Lobsters

---

### 2. Creators & Educators (Secondary)

**Why they care**
- Automatic chapters
- Embedded captions
- Higher retention

**Channels**
- YouTube demos
- Reddit (podcasting, video editing)

---

### 3. Regulated & Enterprise Users (Strategic)

**Why they care**
- Offline compliance
- Auditability
- Deterministic outputs

**Channels**
- LinkedIn
- Whitepapers

---

## Launch Strategy (Now)

### Current Release Focus

**Market Phase 6 + 7 together** as:

> **Automatic Chaptering + Embedded Captions (Offline)**

Not as “speech-to-text.”

---

## Content & Visibility Plan

### Must-Have Assets

1. README with phase-based narrative
2. 20–30s demo (auto chapters → embedded)
3. Before/after video example
4. Clear roadmap graphic (Phase 0–8)

---

## Messaging Pillars (Repeat Everywhere)

1. Local-first, deterministic
2. Structure over text
3. Media-native outputs
4. Algorithmic-first, AI-optional
5. Streaming coming soon

Consistency beats volume.

---

## Competitive Framing (Internal)

| Competitor | They Stop At | You Deliver |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Whisper wrappers | Text | Structure |
| Caption SaaS | Sidecars | Embedded media |
| YouTube | Platform-locked | Portable files |

---

## Measurement of Success

- GitHub stars & forks
- Issues and PRs (signal quality)
- Mentions in dev communities
- Adoption in pipelines

Ignore vanity metrics.

---

## Bottom Line

Across Phases 0–7, **simple_speech has become infrastructure**, not a tool.

Phase 8 is the natural next step — and the roadmap now tells a **coherent, credible story** that the market can understand and repeat.

> **“We don’t just transcribe media. We make it self-describing — automatically.”**
